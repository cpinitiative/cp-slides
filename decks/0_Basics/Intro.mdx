## What is Competitive Programming?

<Content>

- Activity where participants compete to solve algorithmic problems
- Time frame of about 2 - 5 hours
- Competitive programming has many tangible benefits.
  - **Programming Interviews**: Many interviews for large companies require applicants to solve algorithmic problems to demonstrate capability.
  - **College Applications**: There's nothing that boosts your college applications like winning a big award. If you're dedicated enough, you can make it to the USA national competitive programming team's training camp.

## Curriculum

- Bronze to Intermediate Silver
- Minimal prerequisites! (Basic Java knowledge)
- Monthly Contests & Lots of Q&A time!

<Content>

<div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "1fr 1fr", gridGap: "3rem", margin: "2rem auto" }}>

- File / Standard IO
- Time Complexity
- Data Structures
- Simulation
- Rectangle Geometry
- Sorting
- Sets & Maps
- Complete Search


- Recursion
- Ad Hoc
- Greedy
- Graphs
- Binary Search
- Custom Sorting
- Prefix Sums
- Two Pointers

</div>

</Content>

<Notes>

- Curriuclum is Bronze to Silver only due to demographics of people who signed up.
- Our goal is to make this as _accessible_ and _fun_ to everyone as possible.
  - Instead of going faster with curriculum, we chose to participate in fun contests & add more Q&A time instead.

</Notes>

## Want to go faster?

- Self study! https://usaco.guide
- (Coming Soon) https://joincpi.org/classes
- Ask questions during club meetings!
- Participate in monthly contests! (hard silver/gold level)

## Today: IOI Supertrees!

https://oj.uz/problem/view/IOI20_supertrees

<Content>

(This is a hard problem, so don't worry if you don't fully understand the solution!)

We're going over a slightly simplified version.

## Problem Statement

<Content>

Given $n$ towers $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$, create bridges between towers such that there are $p[i][j]$ $(0 \le p[i][j] \le 2)$ different paths from tower $i$ to tower $j$ (assume there's always a solution).

(Assume there's always a solution.)

## Subtask 2 Solution

<Content>

For each "group" of connected towers, pick one tower. Add a bridge from that tower to every other tower in the group.

## Subtask 2 Code

## Subtask 3

$$
p[i][j] = 0 \texttt{ or } 2
$$

(Assume there's always a solution.)

## Subtask 3 Solution

import img3 from "./supertrees_diag3.png";

<Content>

For each connected group, add bridges to make a circle of towers.

<img src={img3} />

## Subtask 3 Code

## Subtask 4

$$
p[i][j] = 0 \texttt{ or } 1 \texttt{ or } 2
$$

## Subtask 4 Solution

<Content>

- For each "group" of connected towers, note that all the towers in that group are either connected to each other with $1$ path or $2$ paths, but never a mix of both.
  - lol wait this is wrong...
- If a group is connected with $1$ path, add a bridge from one node to every other towers.
- If a group is connected with $2$ paths, add bridges to make a circle of towers.
